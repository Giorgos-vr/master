This is a PY dictionary script that allows you to read, add, delete, search_and_edit {name:number} pairs.
Once finished I will attempt to update it to use some kind of database to store data permanently
and maybe give it some kind of GUI either as a web app or a stand-alone program.

This is V0.1, it has the basic functionality described above built as a five-option-menu
which uses a series of dialogues that enable user interface.

Wellcome! :)
