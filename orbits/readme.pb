This is the first version of 'Orbital Resonance Cosmic Sounds'
if you wish to run it please download the entire folder and make sure all the .WAV files are in the same folder as main.py or main.exe otherwise it will crash.
(if you choose to run it through your prefered IDE by loading the .py instead of the .exe please make sure you have all the necessary libraries installed first)

First of all please watch this youtube video as it explains the physical mechanics behind this phenomenon a lot better than I ever could.

The Planets Are Weirdly In Sync
(long story short some planets and some moons are "weirdly in sync" around their parent star or planet and I think this is fascinating!)


So this programm aims to visualise the orbital resonance phenomenon, each planet makes a unique sound once for every complete orbit.
By default the orbiting planets are on a one to two resonance with each other meaning that for every two rotations of the innermost planet
the next one only makes one and that for two of the second one's orbits the trird one makes one etc.

In this version the user can use the check boxes on the left to select which planets will appear in the visualisation
and on the drop-down menu on the right they will find a selection of three speed schemes and two resonanse types (1/2 and 1/3).
So make your selection, click run and enjoy!
